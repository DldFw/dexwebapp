# LRC - Loopring

## What is Loopring?
 
Loopring (LRC) is an open protocol for scalable non-custodial exchanges on Ethereum. The Loopring protocol smart contracts and zero-knowledge proof circuits allow the building of high-performance DEXes using a zkRollup construction. This allows for higher throughput and lower settlement costs without sacrificing Ethereum-level security guarantees. LRC token can be staked by holders to earn protocol fees, and by DEXes as a bond to follow protocol-defined behaviour.
